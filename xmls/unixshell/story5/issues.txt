issues:
In Models M:
- NumOfFiles in ls has only 5 values (up to 1000+) but grep had 10 values
  I've updated NumOfFiles in ls to 10..
  as a result, this restriction is no longer valid:
  NumOfFiles.equals(&quot;1000+&quot;)
   because 1000+ is no longer a valid value .  
 I've changed this restriction to  1001-2000
 
 

in Model B:
- NumOfDir has the exact same problem (ls with 5 values, grep with 10 values)
  fixed the same way.
